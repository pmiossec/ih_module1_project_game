# Pop-it game

"Pop it!" is a 2 players game where the goal is to not be the one that pop the last bubble.

Each turn you could pop between 1 and 3 bubbles situated <em>on the same line</em> before passing the hand to the other player with the <img src="./images/switch.svg" width="20"> button.

You could choose the shape of the board in the settings.

You could decide also in the settings to play againt someone else or the computer with 2 levels of difficulties.

[You can play it here](https://pmiossec.github.io/ih_module1_project_game/)

PS: If you like to pop bubbles a lot and try to pop the top title a lot of times, maybe you will get an easter egg...
